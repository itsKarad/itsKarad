## Heyo
I'm currently finishing my masters at UC Irvine. Previously — Software Engineer @ JP Morgan, graduated from IIT Roorkee.
I'm (trying) to write regularly on my blog, [Bytes & Logs](https://bytesandlogs.me/).

Here's my website → [adityakarad.com](https://adityakarad.com)

I've worked on a few projects → [adityakarad.com/projects](https://adityakarad.com/projects)
